I) About SiAsgt:
----------------

Program SiAsgt is an example program to study Kinetic Monte Carlo,
specifically the Bortz-Kalos-Liebowitz (BKL) algorithm described
in Dr. Kai Nordlund's notes on Kinetic Monte Carlo available at
http://beam.acclab.helsinki.fi/~knordlun/mc/mc8nc.pdf

This program is an assignment in response to Exercise4
http://beam.helsinki.fi/~knordlun/mc/exc6.pdf (see dir docs herein for
a local copy).

It is written in C (gcc) and uses the GNU Scientific Library
available at http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/. GSL is available freely
and is distributed under the GNU pubic liscence.

SiAsgt is written so as to make it easily extensible to solve more
complex KMC problems (more species, more interactions) and also in
a modular way so that more complex material geometries can be fitted
in easily.

II) Installing:
---------------

1) tar -zxvf KMC.tgz
2) cd KMC
3) Edit the makefile and change the PATH to the gsl include files and
   library files. Also make sure that the gsl library is in your
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

III) Directory Structure:
------------------------

It has only one directory KMC under which all programs reside. The main
program is SiAsgt.c. Most of the variables are declared in GlobalVars.h.
The number of species and the number of interactions can also be changed
in GlobalVars.h. All other variables that depend on these two variables
like Jump frequency, migration activation energy, etc are dynamically
allocated arrays (in allocarray.c).

IV) Inputs:
-----------
See file readinputs.c for a description of the inputs in the
input file SiAsgt.inp.

V) Outputs:
-----------
Output is to stdout and a sample output is presented below

Fraction of Interstitials = 3.598000e-01; Error = 3.084598e-03
Fraction of Vacancies = 3.598000e-01; Error = 3.084598e-03
Ratio of Interstitial jumps to Vacancy jumps = 1.304469e-02;
      Error = 8.661340e-04
Simulation time = 9.853298e-06 (seconds); Error = 2.211743e-06
