About RDAlenya:
---------------
RDAlenya is written to study the diffusion limited reactions of hydrogen
isotopes, in Graphite by Manoj Warrier (manoj.Warrier - - gmail.com) and Abha
Rai (abra - - ipp.mpg.de). It uses Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC), specifically,
the Bortz-Kalos-Liebowitz (BKL) algorithm [A. B. Bortz, M. H. Kalos,
J. L. Lebowitz, J. Comp. Phys., 17 (1975) 10 as elucidated in Kai Nordlund's
notes on Monte Carlo [http://beam.acclab.helsinki.fi/~knordlun/mc/mc8nc.pdf].
Duane Johnson's notes on the WWW
[http://www.mcc.uiuc.edu/summerschool/2001/duane%20johnson/kmc_ss.pdf]
The theoritical foundations of dynamical Monte-Carlo is available at
[http://www.mcc.uiuc.edu/summerschool/2001/duane%20johnson/Fichthorn.pdf]

It is written in C (gcc) and uses the GNU Scientific Library available
at [http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/]. GSL is available under the GNU public
license. The code and GSL are highly portable and should work on any *nix
machine with a C compiler. If it does not please send me (M. Warrier) a sample
computer and compiler (hopefully with a lifetime license) and I promise to get
it working on it :-). Please note that this is a pre-alpha release and is
mainly meant for pedagogical purposes.

Units used: All units are in MKS system unless otherwise specified. This is an
adapted version for the Summer School on hydrogen surface interactions to be
held between June 8^th to 13^th 2008 at Alenya, France.

Running the code:
-----------------
cd to the src directory
do: make - to compile the code (making changes to GNU Scientific Library PATH
                                if necessary)
    make run -> to run the code
